## Setup

### Set up the environment

1. Run `make install`, which installs Poetry (if it isn't already installed), sets up a virtual environment and all Python dependencies therein.
2. Run `source .venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment.

### Install new packages

To install new PyPI packages, run:

```shell
poetry add <package-name>
```

### Get an overview of the available commands

Simply write `make` to display a list of the commands available. This includes the
above-mentioned `make install` command, as well as building and viewing documentation,
publishing the code as a package and more.
